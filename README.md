Hello! I am currently a Technical Writer at [Traveloka](https://traveloka.com). My responsibilities are in planning, executing, and delivering new initiatives to standardize various processes through documentation efforts that aim to provide clarity and understanding for engineers, analysts, scientists, and business stakeholders.

Previously, I was a project coordinator at [Mirai Technologies](https://mirai.co.id/). We were  a software house that focused on mobile application development catered towards startups. I managed four teams: iOS, Android, Hybrid, and Backend (plus an UI/UX designer).
