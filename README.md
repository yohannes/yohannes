Hello! I am currently a Technical Writer at [Traveloka](https://traveloka.com). My responsibilities are in planning, executing, and delivering new initiatives to standardize various processes through documentation efforts in order to ultimately provide clarity and understanding for engineers, analysts, scientists, and business stakeholders.

Previously, I was a project coordinator at [Mirai Technologies](https://mirai.co.id/). We were  a software house that focused on mobile application development catered towards startups. I managed four teams: iOS, Android, Hybrid, and Backend (plus an UI/UX designer). 

Prior to that, I was a specialist at [Apple Retail](https://www.apple.com/retail/), where I led all stages of Apple's products & services purchasing efforts, including requirement definitions, pricing structures, supports availability, & third-party products enhancements by engaging and building relationship with customers through hands-on experiences. 

I am reachable at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yohanneswijaya/).
